    <p>Hey! You really went to my donation page huh? I appreciate that, really 💖</p>
    <p>But since I'm still a minor, most donation platforms won't accept me (and also, I don’t even have any donation forms right now 😅).</p>
    <p>It makes me a bit sad, but hey—there's still something *awesome* you can do!</p>
    <p><strong>If you wanna support me, just like my projects!</strong> I post projects here and there, and seeing people support them is the only way I know someone out there believes in what I do. 😄</p>
    <p>So if you *do* support me — thank you! You're awesome. Like, for real. <span class="heart">❤️</span></p>
